## Project Explanation

This website was developed as part of the 2024 Final Project (TCC) for the Computer Science for the Internet course at ETEC Jo√£o Berlamino, in collaboration with the school E. E. Prof. Clodoveu Barbosa. The goal of the project is to facilitate communication regarding schedule changes and announcements from Clodoveu school, promoting the transition to a digital format. This allows the school community to access information from anywhere, at any time.

## Project Structure

The web application uses XAMPP as a local server and a database to store information. Below is a detailed description of the project's folders and subfolders:

### 1. bats

This folder contains scripts to set up and tear down the development environment.

- **CONFIGURAR (English: CONFIGURE)**: Script that automates the setup of XAMPP and the database.
- **DESCONFIGURAR (English: TEAR DOWN)**: Script that removes the configurations of XAMPP and the database.

This is necessary because I am not using a framework; instead, I am creating a custom router system, and to function correctly, it is necessary to modify some XAMPP files.

### 2. Http

This folder contains the system logic, organized in the **controllers** subfolder.

The controllers manage the system logic, processing requests and determining which data will be displayed in the views.

### 3. public

This folder contains all publicly accessible files, such as styles, images, and JavaScript scripts. The subfolders are:

- **css**: Style files (CSS).
- **img**: Images used on the site.
- **js**: JavaScript scripts that add interactivity.

### 4. views

This folder contains the views, which are the pages displayed to the user. The views are controlled by the controllers located in `Http/controllers`. The subfolders are:

- **admin**: Contains all views related to the system administrator.
- **user**: Contains all views aimed at users.
- **session**: Contains views related to login and session management for the administrator.
